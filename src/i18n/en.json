    "paragraph_1": "From the early 20th century, phonetics was closely related to poetic studies and even to the instrumental analysis of speech (Mustazza, 2019), and the relationship between linguistics and poetry has been shown to be strongly connected, as Jakobson (1966) demonstrates. However, despite the growing number of vocal archives and strategies for preserving poetic speech internationally (see Colonna, 2021, Mistrorigo 2019), this branch of research has been understudied. ",
    "paragraph_2": "In recent years, this gap has been relegated to various international areas, such as, theoretical approaches that have opened the debate on the subject of the scientific understandings of poetry reading  in connection with the text (Bernstein, 1999), encompassing various disciplinary branches, which is allowing the beginning of awareness, sensitization, and an increase in the instrumental and interdisciplinary study of this specific and very complex form of speech and its relationship with the written text (e.g., Byers 1979; MacArthur et al. 2018; Colonna, 2022; Barbosa, 2023). This congress aims to contribute to this specific branch of research.",
    "paragraph_3": "For this reason, the recently created international research group Phonetics and Poetics, in collaboration with the Voices of Spanish Poets project, cordially invites all those interested in this area of research to participate in the first edition of the International Congress on Phonetics and Poetics, to be held on November 14-15, 2024, online.",
