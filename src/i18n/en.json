    "subtitle": "The Acoustic Dimension of Poetry: Instrumental and Interdisciplinary Perspectives",
    "paragraph_1": "Originally, from the early 20th century, phonetics was closely related to poetic studies and even to the instrumental analysis of speech (Mustazza, 2019), and the relationship between linguistics and poetry has been shown to be strongly connected, as Jakobson (1966) demonstrates. However, despite the growing number of vocal archives and strategies for preserving poetic speech internationally (see Colonna, 2021, Mistrorigo 2019), this branch of research has been little explored over time.",
    "paragraph_2": "In recent years, this gap has been reduced in various international areas, through theoretical approaches that have opened the debate on the subject (Bernstein, 1999), encompassing various disciplinary branches, which is allowing the beginning of awareness, sensitization, and an increase in the instrumental and interdisciplinary study of this specific and very complex form of speech and its relationship with the written text (e.g., Byers 1979; MacArthur et al. 2018; Colonna, 2022; Barbosa, 2023). This congress aims to contribute to this specific branch of research.",
    "paragraph_3": "For this reason, the recently created international research group Phonetics and Poetics, in collaboration with the Voices of Spanish Poets project, cordially invites all those interested in this area of research to participate in the first edition of the International Congress on Phonetics and Poetics, to be held on November 15, 2024, online.",
    "paragraph_4": "We invite all scholars working on the acoustic dimension of poetry from different approaches to submit a proposal in one of the following thematic areas proposed for the congress:",
    "list": [
      "Phonetics and Poetry: dedicated to the phonetic study of recordings of read or oral poetry",
      "Phonetics and Applied Poetics (Didactics): dedicated to the applications of teaching poetry through phonetics at different levels of instruction",
      "Phonetics, Cognition, and Poetics: dedicated to the study of the results of the acoustic and perceptive dimension of poetic reading through psycholinguistic, cognitive, and psychophysiological correlates methodologies",
      "Phonetics and Metrics: dedicated to the prosodic dimension of the poetic text in relation to its execution and interpretation aloud"
